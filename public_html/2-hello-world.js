// the standard first program in every language:
// print 'hello world' to the screen

console.log('Hello world!'); // the semicolon is optional

// now evaluate this file to see the output of the line above.
// there are several ways to go about this:
// 
// * Ctrl+B in Sublime Text (Cmd+B works on Mac)
// * run 'node 2-hello-world.js' from your working directory at the command line
// * type into the JS console in your browser:
// 			console.log('Hello world!');
// (the semicolon is optional, but it's a good habit to form)
// 
// alternatively, just evaluate 'Hello world!' at a node REPL
// (no need to log the string to the console there)
// what is the difference between the REPL and the node command?

// note that none of these COMMENTED lines are even *noticed* by the JS interpreter
// even if we comment out CODE, it's invisible:

// console.log('this won\'t be printed');

// by the way -- why did we use \' instead of ' in the word "won't," there?
